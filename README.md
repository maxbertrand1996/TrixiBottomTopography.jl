# General
This folder contains a clone of the repository [maxbertrand1996/TrixiBottomTopography.jl](https://github.com/maxbertrand1996/TrixiBottomTopography.jl/tree/main). For our purpose, we will only consider the branch `ma_bertrand_2022`. Additionally, this folder contains `setup` folders which contain the setup for the different simulations which have been used to otbain the results throughout the thesis

To run the simulations, navigate to this folder (`simulations`) on the console and type in the following command to start `Julia` and make use of the package `TrixiBottomTopogrpahy.jl` implemented in this repository:
```
julia --project=@.
```

include("setup_10\\Bic_nak_smth.jl")
```
The resulting file has been used in Figure 8.10 of this thesis.

## setup_11
The files in this setup are used to verify that the well-balanced property is fulfilled when working with B-spline interpolated bottom topographies. In this case, we are interested in the one dimensional case. Therefore the files 
- `linear.jl`
- `cubic_free.jl`
- `cubic_n-a-k.jl`

are implemented in this folder.
These files determine the lake-at-rest error for a lake-at-rest problem when using linear and cubic B-spline interpolated bottom topographies with free and not-a-knot end condition. The underlying data is the same cross-section data as introduced in Section 8.1 of the thesis.

The implemented files run a simulation of the time interval `tspan = [0.0, 10.0]`. To run the simulations, execute:
```julia
include("setup_11\\linear.jl")
include("setup_11\\cubic_free.jl")
include("setup_11\\cubic_n-a-k.jl")
```

Because we need the results of more time intervals than just `tspan = [0.0, 10.0]`, we have to perform the following steps afterwards to obtain all the necessary data:

1. Change `tspan` to `tspan = [0.0, 100.0]` for all the files and re-run the simulations as described above
2. Change `tspan` to `tspan = [0.0, 1000.0]` for all the files and re-run the simulations
3. Change `tspan` to `tspan = [0.0, 10000.0]` for all the files and re-run the simulations

The obtained errors can be found in Table 8.1 of this thesis.

## setup_12
The files in this setup are used to verify that the well-balanced property is fulfilled when working with B-spline interpolated bottom topographies. In this case we are interested in the two dimensional case. Therefore the files 
- `bilinear.jl`
- `bicubic_free.jl`
- `bicubic_n-a-k.jl`

are implemented in this folder.
These files determine the lake-at-rest error for a lake-at-rest problem when using bilinear and bicubic B-spline interpolated bottom topographies with free and not-a-knot end condition. The underlying data is the same Rhine section data as introduced in Section 8.1 of the thesis.

The implemented files run a simulation of the time interval `tspan = [0.0, 10.0]`. To run the simulations, execute:
```julia
include("setup_12\\bilinear.jl")
include("setup_12\\bicubic_free.jl")
include("setup_12\\bicubic_n-a-k.jl")
```

Because we need the results of more time intervals than just `tspan = [0.0, 10.0]`, we have to perform the following steps afterwards, to obtain all the necessary data:

1. Change `tspan` to `tspan = [0.0, 100.0]` for all the files and re-run the simulations as described above
2. Change `tspan` to `tspan = [0.0, 1000.0]` for all the files and re-run the simulations
3. Change `tspan` to `tspan = [0.0, 10000.0]` for all the files and re-run the simulations

The obtained errors can be found in Table 8.2 of this thesis.

```

To start the simulation, execute
```julia

The following `Time` values represent the snapshots for Figures 8.16-8.20

- Figure 8.16: `0`

## setup_31
The files in this setup are used to verify that the well-balanced property is fulfilled when working with B-spline interpolated bottom topographies. In this case, we are interested in the one dimensional case. Therefore the files 
- `linear2.jl`
- `cubic_free2.jl`
- `cubic_n-a-k2.jl`

are implemented in this folder.
These files determine the lake-at-rest error for a lake-at-rest problem when using linear, and cubic B-spline interpolated bottom topographies with free and not-a-knot end condition. The underlying data is the same cross-section data as introduced in Section C.1 of the thesis.

The implemented files run a simulation of the time interval `tspan = [0.0, 10.0]`. To run the simulations, execute:
```julia
include("setup_31\\linear2.jl")
include("setup_31\\cubic_free2.jl")
include("setup_31\\cubic_n-a-k2.jl")
```

Because we need the results of more time intervals than just `tspan = [0.0, 10.0]`, we have to perform the following steps afterwards to obtain all the necessary data:

1. Change `tspan` to `tspan = [0.0, 100.0]` for all the files and re-run the simulations as described above
2. Change `tspan` to `tspan = [0.0, 1000.0]` for all the files and re-run the simulations
3. Change `tspan` to `tspan = [0.0, 10000.0]` for all the files and re-run the simulations

The obtained errors can be found in Table C.1 of this thesis.

- `bicubic_n-a-k2.jl`

are implemented in this folder.
